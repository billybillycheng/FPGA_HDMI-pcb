# FPGA HDMI Experimenting Board PCB Layout Files

Note that this project is still in progress. Most of the work on the schematic
is finished, with the pcb layout being the priority right now.

This board is designed to be relatively cheap (compared to other FPGA options 
with HDMI), and be fairly small at 2x2in. To meet these requirements some corners
were cut (like ESD protection on the HDMI), though it still should function well.

This is not intended to be a consumer device, but rather a development and
experimenting platform for those interested in playing around with HDMI.

# ENJOY!
